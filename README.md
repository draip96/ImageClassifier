# ImageClassifier
CIFAR 10 image classifier implemented with a convolutional neural network architecture. Built in pytorch, the architecture of the CNN was inspired by the keras model in this kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ektasharma/simple-cifar10-cnn-keras-code-with-88-accuracy/notebook.
Using this architecture, the model manages to achieve 85% accuracy on the test set after 100 epochs of training.
